# US Clinical Trial Registry Analysis Helper

This is a tool that digests the raw public registry data and generates a CSV file that displays interventional trials and information relevant to them. This tool was primarily built for UAEM (http://www.uaem.org/) members to quickly assess compliance of research bodies conducting clinical trials to the Declaration of Helsinki in an effort to promote transparency in medical research.

### Prerequisites
